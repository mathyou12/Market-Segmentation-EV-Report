# Market-Segmentation-EV-Report
Data Analysis and Market Segmentation for Electric Vehicles in India

Market Segmentation - Electric Vehicle (EV) Report
Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis and segmentation of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India, with the goal of identifying optimal market segments. The project applies data analysis, machine learning techniques, and market research methods to categorize the market into geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral segments.

The analysis covers data from multiple sources including:

India EV Market Data (2001 - 2024)
Indian Cities Vehicle Data
Electric Vehicle Sales in India
Additional Vehicle Composition Data
The final output will be a market segmentation report with recommendations on which segments to target for launching EV products.

Steps to Run the Analysis

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Market-Segmentation-EV-Report.git
cd Market-Segmentation-EV-Report

Download the necessary datasets from the APIs and place them in the data/ folder.

Install dependencies:

If you haven’t already installed the required libraries, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis:

Open 01_data_preprocessing.ipynb for data cleaning and preparation.
Run 02_clustering_analysis.ipynb for segmentation and clustering using machine learning.
Use 03_segmentation_model.ipynb to finalize the market segmentation and generate the final results.
Generate the Report:

After completing the analysis, use the Python script report_generation.py to compile the results and save them in a .pdf or .docx format.

Report
The final market segmentation analysis report will contain:

Overview of the EV market in India
Data collection and cleaning methodology
Clustering and segmentation process
Profiling and description of the target market segments
Customizing the marketing mix for the target segments
Estimation of potential sales in the early market
Recommendations for the most optimal market segments
Results
The segmentation analysis generates the following outputs:

Clusters of the Indian EV market with identified potential segments.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) results for data visualization.
Recommendations for the most promising segments to target for EV sales.
